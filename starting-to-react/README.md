# Starting to React

Learning React is easier than you think! This workshop will start with a quick explanation of how React fits into the landscape of all the newfangled JavaScript libraries. And then we'll dig in!

We'll go through tutorials together that help you understand the basics of React. By the end of the workshop, you'll likely want to go start building stuff with React!
